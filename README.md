### Overview

The original goal of StateNet was to create a simple way to define and control the flow through pages of an application. The library has many applications and since its inception I have used it in a number of different projects.

NodeMachine defines states as Nodes in a network. You complete a unit of work when a Node is entered and when exited it selects the next node to visit.
